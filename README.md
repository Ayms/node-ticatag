node-ticatag
===

Simple nodejs implementation for the Ticatag [API](https://developers.ticatag.com/api/)

## Ticatag

[Ticatag](http://ticatag.com/) is a French company, part of the French Tech, developing IOT devices, among those the (great) TiFiz

The [TiFiz](http://mytifiz.com) is a very low energy consumption GPS tracker using the [Sigfox network](http://www.sigfox.com/en/coverage) to update its location, also part of the French Tech, which has a much broader coverage than the other networks, especially at sea, it works with a standard battery that only needs to be renewed every year, the TiFiz is obviously much more usable/efficient than any existing tracker, especially those using the GSM network

This module covers all the Ticatag devices available now or later through the APÏ

## Code

The fat arrow ``=>`` is intentionally not used for backward compatibility with previous nodejs versions that we are still using for some projects

## Installation

Install node.js on supported platforms : Unix, Windows, MacOS, then just create a folder and copy ticatag.js
